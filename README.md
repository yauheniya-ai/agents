# AI Agents

This portfolio is built with **React**, **Three.js**, and **TailwindCSS**, and showcases different **AI agents** — each designed for specialized tasks such as research, legal analysis, voice interaction, coding assistance, or web scraping.

It leverages cutting-edge technologies like **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **LangGraph**, **LangSmith**, and others to enable advanced AI use cases such as **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, autonomous agents, and multimodal interaction.
